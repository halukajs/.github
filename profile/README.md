## Information

Haluka was a personal and hobby project by @rawbinary for trying to build a javascript framework for back-end using Node.js. It was built on top of express.js and 
had added custom features for routing, files, database, and many more stuffs.

This project was never fully completed and was not intended to be fully completed and be used for production environment. Also, It is no longer maintained as well.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind this framework was to understand, at a deeper level, how the web and web-frameworks worked to provide developers with ease in the web dev process.
I had the opportunity to learn various aspects and nuances of web development by spending many sleepless nights in front of a computer hacking and debugging code. 
During the journey, I gained a conceptual understanding of many things, which, I believe, has led me to become a better developer than before.

## Why Stopped

TLDR; Life happened!

Slightly longer story; School and life stuffs, unable to manage time for the project, lack of serious motivation after a time, also due to no monetary benefits
(this didn't put food on my table), also no any clear objective or the direction the project was headed to.
This was not any ground-breaking project that needed to be worked on. With evolution of technogies, this project would've been pretty much useless and obsolete
within a few years (as of writing this), already many people are opting for solutions such as Next.js and similar frameworks, and in the growing world of serverless,
framework such as this is bound to get obsolete. Due to all these reasons, it was decided to not continue on this project anymore.
